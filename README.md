Las Tortugueras

## Summary

Our group worked closely with a community conservation organization in Mexico, El Grupo Tortuguero de Bahía de Kino (GTBK), to help organize and interpret their long term sea turtle monitoring data from the Gulf of California. This group... (mission statement). To accomplish this monitoring... (methods). Sophie spent... (our connection to GTBK).

The target questions we were given by GTBK involved quantifying sea turtle recaptures and calculating survey effort, considering variables like species, sex, seasonality and location. The process of summarizing and visualizing GTBK's data required a lot of data cleaning and tidying. We began by organizing and merging two large datasets (dimensions of each, respectively) that collectively covered the group's sea turtle monitoring efforts from 2010-2022.

Once we had answered GTBK's questions, we had more freedom to do some exploratory data vizualization. This is where we were able to incorporate comparisons between two different sea turtle monitoring projects and their findings. The Buck Island Sea Turtle Research Program (BISTRP) is a longterm conservation and monitoring project by the National Park Service in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The two projects are different in many ways. BISTRP monitors a nesting beach throughout the peak nocturnal nesting season and thus only encounters and surveys nesting females. GTBK conducts opportunistic in-water surveys and thus the demographics of the surveyed sea turtles are much more diverse. 

Write-up of your project and findings go here. Think of this as the text
of your presentation. The length should be roughly 5 minutes when read
out loud. Although pacing varies, a 5-minute speech is roughly 750
words. To use the word count addin, select the text you want to count
the words of (probably this is the Summary section of this document, go
to Addins, and select the `Word count` addin). This addin counts words
using two different algorithms, but the results should be similar and as
long as you’re in the ballpark of 750 words, you’re good! The addin will
ignore code chunks and only count the words in prose.

You can also load your data here and present any analysis results /
plots, but I strongly urge you to keep that to a minimum (maybe only the
most important graphic, if you have one you can choose). And make sure
to hide your code with `echo = FALSE` unless the point you are trying to
make is about the code itself. Your results with proper output and
graphics go in your presentation, this space is for a brief summary of
your project.
